        <p>The Super Saiyans of legend were an invincible warrior race! I am their son, and at long last, I have risen to claim my birthright. I have stepped into the ranks of greatness! All my life, I have worked towards this goal and for what...to be brushed aside as easily as a common housefly by an android? A true Super Saiyan would not have fallen. Maybe I'm not who I think I am. Perhaps there are still new plateaus for me to reach. Far greater heights to which I must ascend. Yes. I will ascend. The universe will marvel to see the ultimate Saiyan potential once again realized. And I will be legendary. And then Kakarot, then I will see you bow before your prince!</p>
