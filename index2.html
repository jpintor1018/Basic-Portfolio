        <p>My name is John Pintor. I live a very simple life. I am known to be an ambivert, with both characteristics of an extrovert and an introvert. I am shy at first, usually keeping to myself, but once I get comfortable with you, I start to open up and you get to know the real me. I am not a person who likes to plan anything, since most plans I make never comt to fruition. I'd rather do things spontaneouly, explore the world with no direction. It's fun that way. </p>
        <p>What I do for fun is powerlifting. I started powerlifting in 2016. Not only do I like to test my strength physically, but I like to test my strength mentally as well. I was never the popular kid in high school. I was always the kid that played video games, ate junk food all day, and casually drinking. Powerlifting not only gave me strength physically and mentally, but it gave me the confidence and wisdom and new friends. I am constantly learning everyday. I like to say, "Protein shakes are my alcohol and soreness is my hangover."</p>
